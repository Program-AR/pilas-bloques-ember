## About

Pilas Bloques is an application to learn to program, developed especially for the classroom.
Challenges with various levels of difficulty are proposed to bring students closer to the world of programming through blocks.

### What is programming through blocks?

It is to develop programs with actions and instructions built into blocks or predesigned pieces. The result of fitting the blocks together is the program that solves the problem or challenge posed.

### Why learning by programming with blocks?

Because each abstract concept associated with programming has its visual representation.
Because it saves the difficulties generated by the formal syntax of a written language (and the frustration when we make a mistake when writing!). 
The blocks can be selected, dragged, composed ... and voila, nothing more is necessary!

### How Pilas Bloques is different from other educational tools?

The main difference is that this platform was designed to accompany a didactic sequence for learning programming at school.

###  What is a didactic sequence?

It is the plan by which you intend to learn a topic. The Pilas Bloques didactic sequence was devised and tested by Argentinian teachers and researchers. Today, this proposal is deepening and expanding. Learn more about the initiatives we are approaching the Knowledge Community.

### Who can do the Pilas Bloques challenges?

The challenges can be done by children from 3 to 99 years old ;). However, we currently have two manuals for teachers. One oriented at primary school teachers
called "First Cycle", so that children between 5 and 8 years old will be able to take better advantage of these activities. Another oriented at secondary school teachers called "Second Cycle", children between 9 and 12 years old will be able to take better advantage of these activities.

### Can anyone do this challenges?

The tool is designed to help the teacher and the student in the learning process of programming in a school environment. In our didactic sequence, inquiry-based learning is fundamental. Our recommendation, however, is that the teacher be the one who guides and assists the student's learning process.
