  suggestions: # Will appear over the blocks
    # For the program:
    uses_simple_repetition: Remember to use REPETITION to do something multiple times, instead of many equal blocks!
    # For program or procedure:
    uses_conditional_alternative: Â¿Does your program work only sometimes? You could use conditional alternatives to check for all possible scenarios.
    uses_conditional_repetition: You can use conditional repetition if you need to repeat something until the condition is met.
    main_too_long: Main program is too long and hard to read. Try divinding it into simpler pieces of work using procedures.
    too_long: This procedure is too long and hard to read. Try divinding it into simpler pieces of work using procedures.
    # For each procedure:
    do_something: This procedure is empty and thus does nothing. Add blocks to it so it can work.
    name_was_changed: "You can name this procedure. A good idea for any procedure's name is to think: What does it do?"
    is_used: This procedure is not being used by any part of the program. Click on the hand to create a functional command to use.
    is_used_from_main: This procedure is being used by another one, but that one is not being called by the main program. Check for errors to make it work.
    does_not_use_recursion: Be Careful! This procedure is trying to call itself! Try to tackle this challenge in a different way.
    does_not_nest_control_structures: "This block could be inside a procedure which's name describes what it does."
