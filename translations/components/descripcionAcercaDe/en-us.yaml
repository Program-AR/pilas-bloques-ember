about: About Pilas Bloques
app: 'Pilas Bloques is an application to learn computer programming, specially developed for the classroom.'
challenges: We offer challenges with different levels of complexity to introduce students into the universe of computer programming with blocks.
blocks: What does computer programming with blocks mean?
develop: It means developing programs with actions and instructions introduced by combining blocks. The result of fitting blocks together is a program that (hopefully!) solves the problem or challenge offered.
positive: Why is this learning methodology positive?
concept: Because each abstract <b>concept</b> associated with programming has its <b>visual</b> representation.
difficulties: 'Because it avoids the <b>difficulties</b> produced by the formal syntax of a <b>written</b> language (and the frustration when we make a mistake in writing!). The blocks are selected, dragged, fit together, and the task is ready.'
difference: What makes Pilas Bloques different from the other tools?
learning: The main difference is that this platform was created in <b>support of a didactic sequence</b> to learn programming at school.
sequence: What’s a didactic sequence?
plan: 'It’s the plan by means of which teachers expect students to learn a topic. Pilas Bloques didactic sequence was created and tested by Argentine teachers and researchers. Nowadays, this proposal is being studied in depth and expanded. Learn more about the initiatives we are working on'
whoCanDo: Who can solve Pilas Bloques challenges?
activities: 'These challenges can be solved by anyone. However, at present we offer two Teachers’ Books as supporting material, targeted at the <b> elementary school </b>, so that children between 5 and 8 years old can take advantage of beginner level activities, and children between 9 and 12 years old will be able to take advantage of intermediate level activities.'
anyone: And can anyone solve these challenges on their own?
tool: 'This tool was thought as an <b>aid for the teacher and the student</b> along the teaching-learning process of computer programming at school. In these didactic sequences, the <b>inquiry-based</b> methodology is fundamental. However, our recommendation is that the teacher <b>guide</b> and assist during the student’s learning process.'
